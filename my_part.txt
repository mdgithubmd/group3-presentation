Linux command tcpdump:

tcpdump is a powerful command-line packet analyzer tool for monitoring network traffic in a Unix or Unix-like operating system, such as Linux. It allows you to capture and display network packets on a network interface, making it a valuable tool for network troubleshooting and analysis.

Here's a basic explanation of the tcpdump command and its commonly used options:

Syntax:

tcpdump [options] [expression]


Options:

-i: Specifies the network interface to capture packets from.
-n: Displays numerical addresses instead of resolving hostnames.
-c: Limits the number of packets to capture before exiting.
-s: Sets the snapshot length, limiting the amount of data captured for each packet.
-w: Writes captured packets to a file for later analysis.
-r: Reads packets from a capture file (previously created with -w).
-A: Displays packet data as ASCII (useful for capturing HTTP traffic).
-q: Quiet mode (less verbose output).
-e: Displays link-layer information (Ethernet frame headers).
-X: Displays packet data in both hex and ASCII format.
not port: Excludes packets with a specific port number.
host: Captures packets to or from a specific IP address.
net: Captures packets on a specific network or subnet.
Expression:
You can use various expressions to filter and capture specific packets. For example:

host 192.168.1.1: Captures packets involving the host with IP address 192.168.1.1.
port 80: Captures packets using port 80 (HTTP).
tcp and port 22: Captures TCP packets on port 22 (SSH).
Examples:

Capture all traffic on a specific network interface:

tcpdump -i eth0


Capture and save packets to a file for later analysis:

tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap


Read and analyze packets from a capture file:

tcpdump -r capture.pcap


Capture HTTP traffic on port 80:

tcpdump -i eth0 -A port 80


Capture all DNS traffic to or from a specific host:

tcpdump -i eth0 port 53 and host 192.168.1.1


Please note that using tcpdump may require root (superuser) privileges to capture network packets. Additionally, it's a powerful tool, so use it responsibly and ensure you have the necessary permissions to capture network traffic.
